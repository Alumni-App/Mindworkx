                    Our social responsibility commitment stems from our passion for creating an employed and engaged nation.
                    We are contributors to the Change a Life initiative, a trust that sponsors five highly effective initiatives aimed at combating crime and providing support to victims of crime, with a special focus on children.
                    We are also involved with the Alexandra Education Committee where we chair the mentors committee and hold a seat on the council that manages the organisation.
                    We are mentors to learners and have sponsored bursaries for a number of years, with a commitment to continuing this support into the future.
